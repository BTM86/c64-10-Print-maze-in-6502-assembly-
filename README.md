# c64-10-Print-maze-in-6502-assembly-
The famous "10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1));:GOTO 10" in 6502 assembly for the Commodore 64.

This is just somthing I made for a bit of fun. There are much simpler ways to make the random maze program in assembly with the use of the $FFD2 kernal call. but this on the other hand uses it's own scrolling routines.

I hope you find it intersing and maybe learn something.
